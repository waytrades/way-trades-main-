        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">1. General Policy for Digital Products and Services</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Due to the immediate, irrevocable nature of digital content and subscription-based services, all
          sales of digital products, educational courses, trading signals, mentorship programs, and access
          to private communities are final and non-refundable. Once access to a digital product or service
          has been granted or initiated, it cannot be returned. This policy is in place because:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Instant Access:</span> Upon purchase, you gain immediate access to proprietary information,
            strategies, and community resources.</li>
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Irreversibility:</span> Digital content, once delivered or accessed, cannot be physically returned or
            unlearned.</li>
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Proprietary Information:</span> Our products contain valuable intellectual property and trading
            methodologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We encourage all prospective members to carefully review the product descriptions, features,
          and terms of service before making a purchase. If you have any questions about a specific
          product or service, please contact us prior to completing your transaction.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">2. Subscription Services</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">For subscription-based services (e.g., VIP Access, Trading Signals):</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Cancellation:</span> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Your access to the service will
            continue until the end of your current billing period, and you will not be charged for subsequent
            periods.</li>
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">No Pro-Rata Refunds:</span> We do not offer pro-rata refunds for partial use of a subscription period.
            Cancellation will prevent future charges, but no refunds will be issued for the current or past
            billing cycles.</li>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Refunds may be considered only in the following extremely limited circumstances, at the sole
          discretion of Way Trades:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Duplicate Purchase:</span> If you are accidentally charged twice for the same product or service due
            to a technical error on our part.</li>
          <li><span class="text-white font-medium">Technical Failure:</span> If you are unable to access the purchased digital product or service due to a
            persistent, unresolvable technical issue directly attributable to Way Trades, and our support
            team is unable to provide a solution within a reasonable timeframe. This does not include issues
            arising from your own device, internet connection, or third-party software.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In such exceptional cases, you must contact our support team within 7 days of the purchase
          date, providing detailed evidence of the issue. All refund requests will be reviewed on a
          case-by-case basis.
